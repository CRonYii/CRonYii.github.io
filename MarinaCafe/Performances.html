          <p class="dates">November 2011</p>
          <p>Country music is often established through a sense of “family tradition.” This deep-rooted awareness of musical heritage holds especially true for artist Brian Arrowood. Growing up in the foothills region of the Blue Ridge Mountains of Western North Carolina, Brian Arrowood played music alongside his cousin Andy and his grandfather Paul Birchfield, better known as “Grampsy.” With Brian on fiddle, Andy on mandolin, and Grampsy on guitar, people knew to call "The Mountain Musicians" if they were in need of some good ole time toe-tappin’ music. Brian developed these musical roots deep in the Appalachian soil and now shares his talents with audiences on some of the most impressive stages a musician could hope to play.</p>

          <img class="img-responsive" src="images/JTGray.jpg" alt="JTGray">
          <p class="dates">December 2011</p>
          <p>Bluegrass singer and guitarist J.T. Gray was born in Corinth, MS, the son of a fiddler and a piano player, and moved to Chicago before settling in Nashville, where he opened the Station Inn, a club that became a mecca for bluegrass musicians. He also found time to record and perform with such artists as Jimmy Martin, Vassar Clements, the Sullivan Family, Tom T. Hall, the Boys from Shiloh, and his own band, the Misty Mountain Boys. In December 2005, Gray founded Station Inn Records, its first release being his own album, It's About Time, on which he was backed by some of Nashville's top session players on a collection of traditional country and bluegrass tunes.</p>
